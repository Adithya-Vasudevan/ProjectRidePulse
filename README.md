## Deploy (Streamlit Community Cloud)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io and select your repo.
3. App file: `app.py`
4. Deploy. Done!

## Notes

- Snapshot history saves to `data/snapshots.parquet` (fallback CSV). On cloud hosts, history resets on restart.
- Map uses pydeck. Without a Mapbox token, it uses default basemaps.
- Lottie header is optional; if `streamlit-lottie` fails, the app still runs.
